# Bridging the Generation Gap

The older generation feels there is a generation gap between the younger generation. This is apparently a simple way of communication, dressing, digital skills and Curriculum of education. Even the older generation taught harshly to give an information to the learners, on the other hand of younger generation feels so advance in education and information through the internet.
In the field of education, the existence gap in generation are continuing to grow up unless the changes of generation are adopted. The dominance of digital technology has spread that generation gap becoming wider, as young people become conversant with mobile digital devices, games and social media that didnâ€™t exist when their teachers were growing up.
