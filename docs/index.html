<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 1</span> Using ICT in Developing 21st Century Skills</h1>
<p>“The term “21st-century skills” is generally used to refer to certain core competencies such as collaboration, digital literacy, critical thinking, and problem-solving that advocates believe schools need to teach to help students thrive in today’s world. In a broader sense, however, the idea of what learning in the 21st century should look like is open to interpretation—and controversy."

Creativity involves two processes: thinking, then producing.</p>
<p><strong>Collaboration</strong></p>
<p>Means getting students to work together, achieve compromises, and get the best possible results from solving a problem. The key element of collaboration is willingness. All participants have to be willing to sacrifice parts of their own ideas and adopt others to get results.</p>
