In a broader sense, however, the idea of what learning in the 21st century should look like is open to interpretation—and controversy.\" -Elizabeth Rich 1.1 Learning Skills Critical Thinking Critical thinking is the intellectually disciplined process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from, or generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, as a guide to belief and action. Creativity Creativity is the act of turning new and imaginative ideas into reality. Creativity is characterized by the ability to perceive the world in new ways, to find hidden patterns, to make connections between seemingly unrelated phenomena, and to generate solutions. Creativity involves two processes: thinking, then producing. Collaboration Means getting students to work together, achieve compromises, and get the best possible results from solving a problem. The key element of collaboration is willingness. All participants have to be willing to sacrifice parts of their own ideas and adopt others to get results. Communication To speak appropriately with a wide variety of people whilst maintaining good eye contact, demonstrate a varied vocabulary and tailor your language to your audience, listen effectively, present your ideas appropriately, write clearly and concisely, and work well in a group. 1.2 Literacy Skills Information Literacy Information literacy includes the ability to identify, find, evaluate, and use information effectively. From effective search strategies to evaluation techniques, students learn how to evaluate the quality, credibility, and validity of websites, and give proper credit. Information Literacy has also been referred to as digital literacy or media literacy. Regardless of the terminology, be it digital literacy or media literacy, having information literacy skills are the fundamentals to thrive in a digital space. Media Literacy It provides a framework to access, analyze, evaluate, create and participate with messages in a variety of forms — from print to video to the Internet. Media literacy builds an understanding of the role of media in society as well as essential skills of inquiry and self-expression necessary for citizens of a democracy. Technology Literacy ability to safely, responsibly, creatively, and effectively use appropriate technology to: communicate; access, collect, manage, integrate, and evaluate information; endeavor to predict future needs, solve problems and innovatively create solutions; build and share knowledge; improve and enhance learning in all subject areas and experiences; apply technology and critical thinking to real-world experiences; develop the knowledge and skills to adapt to changing technologies; and use technology to meet personal needs, interests, and learning styles. 1.3 Life Skills Flexibility The capacity to adjust to short-term change quickly and calmly, so that you can deal with unexpected problems or tasks effectively. Leadership A process of social influence, which maximizes the efforts of others, towards the achievement of a goal. Initiative The ability to be resourceful and work without always being told what to do. It requires resilience and determination. Productivity Allow you to become less stressed, more effective and thus, a more successful individual. Social Skills The skills we use everyday to interact and communicate with others. They include verbal and non-verbal communication, such as speech, gesture, facial expression and body language. Definition of 21st Century Skills - The term “21st-century skills” is generally used to refer to certain core competencies such as collaboration, digital literacy, critical thinking, and problem-solving that advocates believe schools need to teach to help students thrive in today’s world (Rich, 2010). Twenty first century has seen rise of a few groundbreaking data innovations that have changed our way of life. Innovation has impacted and changed the way understudies solve issues, investigate data and learn. 21st-century learning is getting to be a disruption to conventional. Instruction as we know it. Nowadays, actualities and data are omnipresent. Data is promptly current and available through the web. ICT (Information Communications and Technology) Refers to all communication technologies, including the internet, wireless networks, cell phones, computers, software, middleware, video-conferencing, social networking, and other media applications and services enabling users to access, retrieve, store, transmit, and manipulate information in a digital form. (AIMS) nformation and communication technologies (ICT) is a broader term for information technology (IT). ICT refers to technologies that provide access to information through telecommunications. Information and communication technology can simply be defined in its simplest form as an electronic medium for creating, storing, manipulating receiving and sending information from one place to another. Diverse set of technological tools and resources used to transmit, store, create, share or exchange information. ICT in 21st Century It incarnates the vision for learning and teaching with the use of information, communication, technology tools in order to provide to the students significant 21st century skills such as personal and social responsibility, critical thinking, digital competence, as well as collaboration and communication. ICT in learning skills Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in education is the mode of education that use information and communications technology to support, enhance, and optimize the delivery of information. Worldwide research has shown that ICT can lead to an improved student learning and better teaching methods. ICT helps teachers to interact with students. It helps in improve Teaching skill, helps in innovative Teaching. It helps in effectiveness of classroom. It also helps in improving professional Development and Educational management as well as enhances Active Learning of teacher Trainees. ICT literate Literacy with ICT is about critical and creative thinking, digital citizenship, and knowing how to use technology safely, healthily, responsibly and ethically to meet our needs. Today, many students are quite comfortable with some technologies and may even be more knowledgeable than their teachers in their use. ICT in life skills Technology excites and engages young people. Technology is an effective tool for teaching life skills. Technology skills are extremely valuable in today’s job market. Today’s technologies offer young people a means of expressing their views on issues that affect them. Youth frequently stay involved in technology-related programs, even after the program ends. Approaches involving technology can be a good fit for companies. Technology can help enhance your program’s sustainability. 1.4 Generalization We know the affect and transformational encounter innovation brings, but it is vital to see at the utilize of innovation within the classroom by inquiring ourselves “What do we need students to learn?”, and after we have the objective, \"How can innovation change the learning involvement. Inquiring these questions in this way keeps the center on learning and not on innovation integration.

The two essential components of project-based learning are an engaging and motivating question and a product that meaningfully addresses that question. Important characteristics of project-based learning, according to the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE), include the following: Students can shape the project to fit their own interests and abilities. Students collect and analyze information, make discoveries, and report their results. Students conduct research using multiple sources of information. The project cuts across a number of disciplines. Students must draw on a broad range of knowledge and skills. The project extends over a significant period of time. The project involves the design and development of a product, presentation, or performance that can be used or viewed by others. The context for the subject matter is larger than the immediate lesson. The instruction and facilitation is guided by a broad range of teaching goals. Problem-Based Learning Problem-based learning is an instructional strategy in which students work cooperatively to investigate and resolve an ill-structured problem based on real-world issues or situations. The steps involved in problem-based learning include: Determining what the problem is; Creating a specific statement of the problem; Identifying the information needed; Identifying the resources to be used to find that information; Developing a possible solution; Analyzing and refining the solution; Presenting the final solution, orally and/or in writing. Project-based learning and problem-based learning have a great deal in common. Involve realistic problems and situations. Are based on authentic educational goals. Include formative and summative evaluation, Are learners centered and teacher facilitated. Are intrinsically engaging and motivating. Are frequently multidisciplinary. Improve students’ research and problem-solving skills, as well as their ability to work cooperatively with their peers. The difference between the two lies largely in their application: Problem-based learning focuses on the problem and the process, while project-based learning focuses on the product. Digital Resources It can be defined as materials that have been conceived and created digitally or by converting analogue materials to a digital format, applications, software, programs or websites that engage students in learning activities and support students’ learning goals. 2.1 Digital Learning Resources Digitally formatted materials included in the context of a course that support the learner’s achievement of the described learning goals. Types of Digital Learning Resources text (online articles websites, e-books, blogs, manuals and reports) graphics (photos, paintings, drawing, cartoons, illustration ) audio (podcast) animation(animated demos, processes) simulation(virtual world, second life) games(mine craft, portal, spore) Why digital learning resources? - Relevant and regularly updated content - Expanded learning opportunities - Easier monitoring of student progress - Allows for immediate feedback to learners - Facilitates collaborative learning Productivity Software These software’s are becoming more popular and more in demand to learn for employment.

This is apparently a simple way of communication, dressing, digital skills and Curriculum of education. Even the older generation taught harshly to give an information to the learners, on the other hand of younger generation feels so advance in education and information through the internet. In the field of education, the existence gap in generation are continuing to grow up unless the changes of generation are adopted. The dominance of digital technology has spread that generation gap becoming wider, as young people become conversant with mobile digital devices, games and social media that didn’t exist when their teachers were growing up. 3.1 Generation the average span of time between the birth of parents and that of their offspring Four Generation BABY Boomers – Bloom in the mid-century. GEN X – Born early-to-mid 1960’s – early 1980’s GEN Y – Born after 1981 GEN Z (ALPHA) – Birth between 1995 and 2019 Gap - a space between two things Generation Gap - Wide differences in cultural norms between the younger generation and the elder Older Generation - Often feels that there is a generation gap between them and the younger generation. - The gap is apparent in simple things like manner of dressing, way of socializing, entertainment, intimate relationships, etc. ##Mode of Learning In the field of education, a huge generation gap also exists and it will continue to widen unless some changes are adopted at the proper time. For Example: The educational curriculum is low compared to the other countries In peasant third world countries where schools don’t have technology facilities, it is understandable, that the transition to digital education may take time. But given the rapid emergence of digital technology, at times referred to as information and communication technology (ICT), there is the need to prepare for bridging the digital gap in the society. Information and Communication Technology The use of hardware and software for efficient management of information. Refers to the forms of technology that are used to transmit, store, create, share or exchange particular task. Understanding Potential of ICT The new network of instantaneous communication is global, overcoming, borders between countries and continents. Much of what elders believe may not applicable anymore to the new generation, especially along matters of traditional value.
