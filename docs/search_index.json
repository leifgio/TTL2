In a broader sense, however, the idea of what learning in the 21st century should look like is open to interpretation—and controversy.\" -Elizabeth Rich 1.1 Learning Skills Critical Thinking Critical thinking is the intellectually disciplined process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from, or generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, as a guide to belief and action. Creativity Creativity is the act of turning new and imaginative ideas into reality. Creativity is characterized by the ability to perceive the world in new ways, to find hidden patterns, to make connections between seemingly unrelated phenomena, and to generate solutions. Creativity involves two processes: thinking, then producing. Collaboration Means getting students to work together, achieve compromises, and get the best possible results from solving a problem. The key element of collaboration is willingness. All participants have to be willing to sacrifice parts of their own ideas and adopt others to get results. Communication To speak appropriately with a wide variety of people whilst maintaining good eye contact, demonstrate a varied vocabulary and tailor your language to your audience, listen effectively, present your ideas appropriately, write clearly and concisely, and work well in a group. 1.2 Literacy Skills Information Literacy Information literacy includes the ability to identify, find, evaluate, and use information effectively. From effective search strategies to evaluation techniques, students learn how to evaluate the quality, credibility, and validity of websites, and give proper credit. Information Literacy has also been referred to as digital literacy or media literacy. Regardless of the terminology, be it digital literacy or media literacy, having information literacy skills are the fundamentals to thrive in a digital space. Media Literacy It provides a framework to access, analyze, evaluate, create and participate with messages in a variety of forms — from print to video to the Internet. Media literacy builds an understanding of the role of media in society as well as essential skills of inquiry and self-expression necessary for citizens of a democracy. Technology Literacy ability to safely, responsibly, creatively, and effectively use appropriate technology to: communicate; access, collect, manage, integrate, and evaluate information; endeavor to predict future needs, solve problems and innovatively create solutions; build and share knowledge; improve and enhance learning in all subject areas and experiences; apply technology and critical thinking to real-world experiences; develop the knowledge and skills to adapt to changing technologies; and use technology to meet personal needs, interests, and learning styles. 1.3 Life Skills Flexibility The capacity to adjust to short-term change quickly and calmly, so that you can deal with unexpected problems or tasks effectively. Leadership A process of social influence, which maximizes the efforts of others, towards the achievement of a goal. Initiative The ability to be resourceful and work without always being told what to do. It requires resilience and determination. Productivity Allow you to become less stressed, more effective and thus, a more successful individual. Social Skills The skills we use everyday to interact and communicate with others. They include verbal and non-verbal communication, such as speech, gesture, facial expression and body language. Definition of 21st Century Skills - The term “21st-century skills” is generally used to refer to certain core competencies such as collaboration, digital literacy, critical thinking, and problem-solving that advocates believe schools need to teach to help students thrive in today’s world (Rich, 2010). Twenty first century has seen rise of a few groundbreaking data innovations that have changed our way of life. Innovation has impacted and changed the way understudies solve issues, investigate data and learn. 21st-century learning is getting to be a disruption to conventional. Instruction as we know it. Nowadays, actualities and data are omnipresent. Data is promptly current and available through the web. ICT (Information Communications and Technology) Refers to all communication technologies, including the internet, wireless networks, cell phones, computers, software, middleware, video-conferencing, social networking, and other media applications and services enabling users to access, retrieve, store, transmit, and manipulate information in a digital form. (AIMS) nformation and communication technologies (ICT) is a broader term for information technology (IT). ICT refers to technologies that provide access to information through telecommunications. Information and communication technology can simply be defined in its simplest form as an electronic medium for creating, storing, manipulating receiving and sending information from one place to another. Diverse set of technological tools and resources used to transmit, store, create, share or exchange information. ICT in 21st Century It incarnates the vision for learning and teaching with the use of information, communication, technology tools in order to provide to the students significant 21st century skills such as personal and social responsibility, critical thinking, digital competence, as well as collaboration and communication. ICT in learning skills Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in education is the mode of education that use information and communications technology to support, enhance, and optimize the delivery of information. Worldwide research has shown that ICT can lead to an improved student learning and better teaching methods. ICT helps teachers to interact with students. It helps in improve Teaching skill, helps in innovative Teaching. It helps in effectiveness of classroom. It also helps in improving professional Development and Educational management as well as enhances Active Learning of teacher Trainees. ICT literate Literacy with ICT is about critical and creative thinking, digital citizenship, and knowing how to use technology safely, healthily, responsibly and ethically to meet our needs. Today, many students are quite comfortable with some technologies and may even be more knowledgeable than their teachers in their use. ICT in life skills Technology excites and engages young people. Technology is an effective tool for teaching life skills. Technology skills are extremely valuable in today’s job market. Today’s technologies offer young people a means of expressing their views on issues that affect them. Youth frequently stay involved in technology-related programs, even after the program ends. Approaches involving technology can be a good fit for companies. Technology can help enhance your program’s sustainability. 1.4 Generalization We know the affect and transformational encounter innovation brings, but it is vital to see at the utilize of innovation within the classroom by inquiring ourselves “What do we need students to learn?”, and after we have the objective, \"How can innovation change the learning involvement. Inquiring these questions in this way keeps the center on learning and not on innovation integration. "],["project-based-and-problem-based-learning.html", "Chapter 2 Project-Based and Problem-Based Learning 2.1 Digital Learning Resources 2.2 Non-Digital Teaching and Learning Resources", " Chapter 2 Project-Based and Problem-Based Learning Project-based Learning Project-based learning is an instructional strategy in which students work cooperatively over time to create a product, presentation, or performance. The two essential components of project-based learning are an engaging and motivating question and a product that meaningfully addresses that question. Important characteristics of project-based learning, according to the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE), include the following: Students can shape the project to fit their own interests and abilities. Students collect and analyze information, make discoveries, and report their results. Students conduct research using multiple sources of information. The project cuts across a number of disciplines. Students must draw on a broad range of knowledge and skills. The project extends over a significant period of time. The project involves the design and development of a product, presentation, or performance that can be used or viewed by others. The context for the subject matter is larger than the immediate lesson. The instruction and facilitation is guided by a broad range of teaching goals. Problem-Based Learning Problem-based learning is an instructional strategy in which students work cooperatively to investigate and resolve an ill-structured problem based on real-world issues or situations. The steps involved in problem-based learning include: Determining what the problem is; Creating a specific statement of the problem; Identifying the information needed; Identifying the resources to be used to find that information; Developing a possible solution; Analyzing and refining the solution; Presenting the final solution, orally and/or in writing. Project-based learning and problem-based learning have a great deal in common. Involve realistic problems and situations. Are based on authentic educational goals. Include formative and summative evaluation, Are learners centered and teacher facilitated. Are intrinsically engaging and motivating. Are frequently multidisciplinary. Improve students’ research and problem-solving skills, as well as their ability to work cooperatively with their peers. The difference between the two lies largely in their application: Problem-based learning focuses on the problem and the process, while project-based learning focuses on the product. Digital Resources It can be defined as materials that have been conceived and created digitally or by converting analogue materials to a digital format, applications, software, programs or websites that engage students in learning activities and support students’ learning goals. 2.1 Digital Learning Resources Digitally formatted materials included in the context of a course that support the learner’s achievement of the described learning goals. Types of Digital Learning Resources text (online articles websites, e-books, blogs, manuals and reports) graphics (photos, paintings, drawing, cartoons, illustration ) audio (podcast) animation(animated demos, processes) simulation(virtual world, second life) games(mine craft, portal, spore) Why digital learning resources? - Relevant and regularly updated content - Expanded learning opportunities - Easier monitoring of student progress - Allows for immediate feedback to learners - Facilitates collaborative learning Productivity Software These software’s are becoming more popular and more in demand to learn for employment. It makes people more efficient and effective in their daily activities.- These programs enhance a teacher’s lesson plan and allow the teacher to take their students beyond textbooks and boring lectures. Three Popular applications: Word processing (MS word, Google Docs) Create or edit a typed document. Modify or edit text like its format, size, color, fonts and etc. Adding clip arts, change margins, spell check. Spreadsheets (MS Excel) It organizes data in rows and columns in a worksheet. More than 15 million cells can hold data. In cells you can add formulas or function, adding them can affect cells that are modified, automatically. Database (MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, FoxPro) A system that collects data and allows access, retrieval and use of the data. Data can contain text, numbers, dates or hyperlinks.You can sort, query and generate reports from it. Other Productivity Software Excel - A Productivity tool when dealing in math and science situations. Charts and graphs can help visually in creating difference in numerical data. PowerPoint - Enables teacher to make slides of their notes, Projecting slides onto a screen. Productivity Software List Google Apps for Business Libre Office Productivity Suite Open Office Microsoft Office WordPerfect Office X5 Advantages: Stimulate a student’s mind using color, pictures, graphs activities and so much more. Time and efficiency Increase amount of information. Varied Learning Experience Flexible Interactive resources can provide students with feedback. Disadvantages: Expensive to license or create. Technology Problems, Expensive equipment, Inhibit students’ access. Loss of Connectivity, computer freezes, power cuts. Technology skills needed. 2.2 Non-Digital Teaching and Learning Resources Non-digital Resources Not relating to or using computers, the internet or other digital technology. Paper based materials such as leveled text and trade books, or a textbook as appropriate. Examples: Boards, Whiteboards Flipchart Paper Handouts Advantages: Boards are quick and easy to use, available in 99% teaching accommodations. Brings out creativity Reliable Enhance writing and reading skills. Disadvantages: Time consuming Limited Resources Limited Learning experience Examples of non-digital teaching and learning resources Whiteboard Flipchart Paper Handouts "],["bridging-the-generation-gap.html", "Chapter 3 Bridging the Generation Gap 3.1 Generation 3.2 Mode of Learning 3.3 Generalization", " Chapter 3 Bridging the Generation Gap The older generation feels there is a generation gap between the younger generation. This is apparently a simple way of communication, dressing, digital skills and Curriculum of education. Even the older generation taught harshly to give an information to the learners, on the other hand of younger generation feels so advance in education and information through the internet. In the field of education, the existence gap in generation are continuing to grow up unless the changes of generation are adopted. The dominance of digital technology has spread that generation gap becoming wider, as young people become conversant with mobile digital devices, games and social media that didn’t exist when their teachers were growing up. 3.1 Generation the average span of time between the birth of parents and that of their offspring Four Generation BABY Boomers – Bloom in the mid-century. GEN X – Born early-to-mid 1960’s – early 1980’s GEN Y – Born after 1981 GEN Z (ALPHA) – Birth between 1995 and 2019 Gap - a space between two things Generation Gap - Wide differences in cultural norms between the younger generation and the elder Older Generation - Often feels that there is a generation gap between them and the younger generation. - The gap is apparent in simple things like manner of dressing, way of socializing, entertainment, intimate relationships, etc. 3.2 Mode of Learning In the field of education, a huge generation gap also exists and it will continue to widen unless some changes are adopted at the proper time. For Example: The educational curriculum is low compared to the other countries In peasant third world countries where schools don’t have technology facilities, it is understandable, that the transition to digital education may take time. But given the rapid emergence of digital technology, at times referred to as information and communication technology (ICT), there is the need to prepare for bridging the digital gap in the society. Information and Communication Technology The use of hardware and software for efficient management of information. Refers to the forms of technology that are used to transmit, store, create, share or exchange particular task. Understanding Potential of ICT The new network of instantaneous communication is global, overcoming, borders between countries and continents. Much of what elders believe may not applicable anymore to the new generation, especially along matters of traditional value. 3.3 Generalization Since the new generations are expected to face a future professional challenge of digital world ahead of them, technology supported skills need to be taught in schools today or else, schools will become white elephant. "],["understanding-technology-learners.html", "Chapter 4 Understanding Technology Learners 4.1 Learner 4.2 21st Century Learning 4.3 Today’s Learner 4.4 Generalization", " Chapter 4 Understanding Technology Learners Our Teachers today generally use the traditional education program applicable to Learners of the past, acquainted with linear, textual and sequential learning. They fail to realize that the new generation 21st millennium is the kind of learners that they were, but are information technology or digital learners. The 21st century education is going to be empowered by digital learners pretty soon as the is beginning is coming. 53% of students use a smart phone and are concerned and prefer the internet. 78% of the students believe and prefer learning through technology. Even in classes, their concentration is questionable as they are uneasy to simply sit and listen. They become alive again through video presentations, group activities and computer classes. Information technology learners (Digital Learners) - A video presentation is discussing the characteristics of a digital learner 4.1 Learner Traditional Learner – basically, a leaner who makes use of traditional ways of learning; one who studies from books and other second sources of information. Technology Learner- Anyone who makes use of man-made inventions such as books in learning. However, in the context of Educational Technology, we are referring to Technology learner’s as Digital Learner’s, a learner who learns with the use of technology, anything that is digital. 4.2 21st Century Learning Collaboration learning how to work with others to achieved a common purpose. Students bring gadgets with them as well as presenting the knowledge the knowledge and abilities they have to come up with a product solution. Communication Students use mobile devices to discuss content they are learning with others, set goals for themselves, and share new concepts. The Lines of communication now become multi- directional and extend beyond the classroom. Critical Thinking helps to construct a firm foundation for personalized learning in many classrooms, teachers don’t provide the time necessary for critical thinking in order to develop original solutions to problems, many of the problems that are provided to students also have only one possible right or wrong answer don’t encourage true critical thinking. Creativity Students make use of their imagination as well as technologies to create new things to think beyond things. 4.3 Today’s Learner Today’s learners appear smarter, yet they can’t read as their parents do and they are addicted to the internet. Even in classes, their concentration is questionable as they are uneasy to simply sit and listen. They become alive again through video presentations, group activities and computer classes. It is to be admitted that our teachers today generally use the traditional education program applicable to learners of the past, acquainted with linear, textual, and sequential learning. They fail to realize that the new generation of the 21st millennium is not the kind of learner that they were, but are information technology or digital learners. The new learners spend much time talking with friends on their cell phones, sending text messages, interacting through Internet media like Facebook, playing video games and surfing the World Wide Web. 4.4 Generalization In general Understanding technology learner’s Learners these days are more store of visual presentation made or displayed by their educators more than simply unadulterated tuning in. They are likewise not intrigued much in the discourse if there’s nothing to pull in them. Some way or another, having this new innovation made the method for showing too hard in light of the fact that the instructor MUST have or get something quite recently to draw in their understudies dissimilar to before everything was so basic. In any case, then, we must adapt up to what our surroundings are currently into, and that is fundamentally Innovation. It is on us on how we keep it adjust without going up against its harsh path for both educator and learners. How about we make utilization of it on a way it could help and we can learn. Not to damage by any stretch of the imagination. The new generation of the 21st millennium is not the kind of learner that they were, but are information technology or digital learners.

These basic literacies will not replace the 3R’s (Reading, Writings and arithmetic), but they will be complemented by six essential skills to equip students for success in the millennial world. Rather than call them literacy skills, these are better referred to as fluency skills conveying the ease and facility in acquiring and using them 5.1 Solution Fluency This refers to the capacity and creativity in problem solving. It requires whole brain thinking executed when students define a problem, design the appropriate solution, apply the solution, and assess the process and result. 6 D’s of Solution Fluency Define the problem, because you need to know exactly what you’re doing before you start. Discover a solution, because planning prevents wasted effort. Dream up a process, one that is suitable and efficient. Design the process in an accurate and detailed action plan. Deliver by putting the plan into action by both producing and publishing the solution. Debrief and foster ownership by evaluating the problem solving process. 5.2 Information Fluency This refers to the capacity and creativity in problem solving. This involves 3 subset skills: - ability to access information - ability to retrieve information - ability reflect on, assess and rewrite for instructive information packages. Information Fluency has 5 A’s Ask Acquire Analyse Apply Assess 5.3 Collaboration Fluency This refers to teamwork with virtual or real partner in the online environment. Working, playing, and learning in today’s digital world involves working with others. It is the spirit of collaboration that will stimulate progress in our global marketplace, in our social networks, and in our ability to create products of value and substance. Collaboration fluency is the ability to successfully work and interact with virtual and real partners. Process of Collaboration Establish Envision Engineer Execute Examine 5.4 Media Fluency Media refer to channels of mass communication (radio, television, magazine, advertising, graphic arts) or digital sources. There is a need for an analytical mind to evaluate the message in a chosen media, as well as creative ability to publish digital messages. There are paid-for and free-domains, such as blog pages, in which personal reflection or journal messages can be published without cost. Sites on the educational sector especially of developed countries, published articles, researches and lesson plans are easily accessible by researchers and learners. 5.5 Creative FLuency Artistic fluency adds meaning by way of design, arts, and storytelling to package a message. Font, color, patterns, layout are elements to creative fluency. Template of PowerPoint presentation and blogs are available for free access in the internet. Process in creative Fluency Identify Inspire Interpolate Imagine Inspect 5.6 Digital Ethics The digital citizen is guided by the principles of leadership, global, responsibility, environmental awareness, global citizenship, and personal accountability. Sad to say, the digital world is not free from those who exploit the digital space for personal selfish commercial and criminal activities. Bloom’s Taxonomy Blooms taxonomy was created in 1950 by educational psychologist Benjamin Bloom.The three lower levels : Knowledge, Comprehension, and Application are most basic level of cognition or also called lower order thinking skills. This may include concrete thinking, memorization and understanding. The three upper levels: Analysis, Synthesis and Evaluation refers to as Higher order thinking skills. It includes abstract, critical , meta cognitive and creative thinking In 1990’s blooms taxonomy was updated by David Krathwohl and Loren Anderson the former student of Benjamin Bloom. To make the model relevant to the 21 st century learner one of their main change was updating the noun associated with each level to action oriented verbs, they also reorder the last two steps, evaluation which was the previously at the top was move down and create or the synthesis move to the top.In recent years there is many interpretation with blooms taxonomy like reverse pyramid, bulb and so on but thinking about how technology affects this model they consider it as “Blooms Digital Taxonomy” This updated version aims to expand upon the skills associate with each level as technology become more essential part in the learning. For example in creating, learners are designing, inventing and constructing a piece of work that shows what they know, one could add digital words to creating like blog, remix, editing or program. Adding digital words to taxonomy also promotes 21 st century skills like communication, collaboration, creativity and critical thinking. There are tools that help student analyze and make sense of content like reading charts, graphs or mind maps or you can think about what tools support the students creation like producing like podcasting, vlogging, coding, editing, animation, slideshow, design a poster and more with this examples the focus should not necessarily be on the tools and themselves but on how the tools can be a way on transforming students thinking in different levels 4D’s of Problem Solving Approach Define the relevant problem statement by identifying the real issue. Develop the necessary Hypothesis to solve the problem Diagnose test the relevant hypotheses to identify the real issues through data analysis and primary/secondary source Direct the results of data analysis to form a solid recommendation and look for necessary feedback. "],["preferences-of-technology-generation.html", "Chapter 6 Preferences of Technology Generation 6.1 Difference between Old and Young Generation 6.2 Generalization", " Chapter 6 Preferences of Technology Generation What the old generation likes may not be the same as what the new generation prefers in their life, work and leisure. Sad to say, much of the good things enjoyed by elders when they were students are no longer available to the new generation. Post-war II gardening classes in which students engaged in seedbed preparation, planting and nurturing of vegetables plants in wide school grounds are no longer part of the school program. Vocational, cultural and values classes have also been minimized due to emphasis on the basics of English, Mathematics and Science. The state dictates educational priorities based on perceptions on the country’s nee to strengthen its agricultural, business or industrial economy. As technology stages a change along a global dimension, lawmakers are challenged to adopt wisdom in calibrating the genuine needs of development and not be copycats of other nations, forgetting indigenous potentials in people, land, mineral resources, forestry, and sea space which make the country rich for long term 6.1 Difference between Old and Young Generation Text versus Visuals Our parents read book texts, enriched by illustrations and photos. In order to research, they go to the school library, use the card catalogue of needed books, and sign up to borrow books for home reading. The technology or digital generation has greater affinity to visuals (photos and video) compared with texts. In fact, they have been exposed since childhood to cable television and video images especially cartoon characters, and then to computer images, in such a manner that their visual fluency. Or abilities have been sharpened and enhanced. Linear versus Hypermedia The past-30-year-old generation has obtained information in a linear, logical and sequential manner. On the positive side, this has made them more logical, focused, and reflective thinkers. The new generation, however, follow a personal random access to hyperlinked digital information, less superior to elders in focus and reflection. Thus, they appear to be more easily bored and distracted during class lectures. Independent vs Social Learners The traditional education system gives priority to independent learning, prior to participative work. New learners, however, are already acquainted with digital tools that adopt to both personal and participative work. They take opportunity for dozens of instantaneous ways to communicate with other-mobile calls and texts, emails, Facebook, Youtube, MySapce, Twitter wikis, etc. Experts describe this mode of digital learning as one that is based on experimentation, discovery and intuition. Learning to do vs Learning to pass the test Old teachers teach students in order to help them to pass the test and complete the course requirement. On the other hand, new digital learners simply wish to acquire skills, knowledge and habits as windows of opportunity afford them to learn. ur parents have complete course and have engaged in a permanent job for most of their lives. A different work situation awaits the digital generation with the contractual, multitasked, and multi-career opportunities in a general world ahead of them Delayed rewards and instant gratification The traditional reward system in education consist in the grades, honor certificates/medals, and diplomas. Including future jobs, the traditional school’s reward system consist of unclear rewards for performance. On the other hand digital learners on their own experience more immediate gratification through immediate scores from games, enjoyable conversation from web cam calls, excitement from email chats, and inviting comments from their Facebook account. Rote memory vs Fun Learning Teacher feel obliged to delivering content-based courses, the learning of which is measurable by standard test. Digital learners prefer fun learning which relevant and instantaneously useful to them. Learning is play to a new learner and not surprisingly there is much fun in the digital world outside the school. Teacher need connect with digital learners, and not think of them as entering their past- 30 years old traditional world. While there are apparent set back limitation to digital learning, there are opportunities to tap through: The new learners digital fluency with visual learning with the use of audio visuals, media and multimedia Using hyperlinked multimedia for projects that enhance work focus and reflection; Problem solving Activities to suit the new generation’s style and preference for fun and relevant learning. 6.2 Generalization To put it all together, even though the older generation may have a big gap to the younger generation, older generation is also trying to adapt on technology. And they may not be as good compared to us when it comes to the trend now days; they also have great experience on their own that the today’s generation is not able to experience. We all know that technology is the way of everyone to everything now days. And that one of the reason that we should share our knowledge in technology to much older people than us for them also to experience the new normal of our generation whether they will agree or not. It’s also our ways for them to understand and us also to understand the gap our generation. We may have different perceptions on things but we have similar goals and we just express or apply them differently. "]]
