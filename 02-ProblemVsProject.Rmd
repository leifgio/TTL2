# Project-Based and Problem-Based Learning

**Project-based Learning**

Project-based learning is an instructional strategy in which students work
cooperatively over time to create a product, presentation, or performance. The two
essential components of project-based learning are an engaging and motivating
question and a product that meaningfully addresses that question.

Important characteristics of project-based learning, according to the
International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE), include the following:

- Students can shape the project to fit their own interests and abilities.
- Students collect and analyze information, make discoveries, and report their
results.
- Students conduct research using multiple sources of information.
- The project cuts across a number of disciplines.
- Students must draw on a broad range of knowledge and skills.
- The project extends over a significant period of time.
- The project involves the design and development of a product, presentation, or
performance that can be used or viewed by others.
- The context for the subject matter is larger than the immediate lesson.
- The instruction and facilitation is guided by a broad range of teaching goals.

**Problem-Based Learning**

Problem-based learning is an instructional strategy in which students work cooperatively to investigate and resolve an ill-structured problem based on real-world issues or situations. The steps involved in problem-based learning include:

- Determining what the problem is;
- Creating a specific statement of the problem;
- Identifying the information needed;
- Identifying the resources to be used to find that information;
- Developing a possible solution;
- Analyzing and refining the solution;
- Presenting the final solution, orally and/or in writing.

Project-based learning and problem-based learning have a great deal in common.

- Involve realistic problems and situations.
- Are based on authentic educational goals.
- Include formative and summative evaluation,
- Are learners centered and teacher facilitated.
- Are intrinsically engaging and motivating.
- Are frequently multidisciplinary.
- Improve students' research and problem-solving skills, as well as their ability to work cooperatively with their peers.
The difference between the two lies largely in their application: Problem-based learning focuses on the problem and the process, while project-based learning focuses on the product.

**Digital Resources**

It can be defined as materials that have been conceived and created digitally or
by converting analogue materials to a digital format, applications, software, programs
or websites that engage students in learning activities and support students' learning
goals.

## Digital Learning Resources
Digitally formatted materials included in the context of a course that support the learner's achievement of the described
learning goals.

**Types of Digital Learning Resources**

- text (online articles websites, e-books, blogs, manuals and reports)
- graphics (photos, paintings, drawing, cartoons, illustration )
- audio (podcast)
- animation(animated demos, processes)
- simulation(virtual world, second life)
- games(mine craft, portal, spore)

**Why digital learning resources?**
- Relevant and regularly updated content
- Expanded learning opportunities
- Easier monitoring of student progress
- Allows for immediate feedback to learners
- Facilitates collaborative learning

*Productivity Software*

- These softwareâ€™s are becoming more popular and more in demand to learn for
employment. It makes people more efficient and effective in their daily
activities.-
These programs enhance a teacher's lesson plan and allow the teacher to take
their students beyond textbooks and boring lectures.

*Three Popular applications:*

- **Word processing** (MS word, Google Docs)
Create or edit a typed document. Modify or edit text like its format, size, color, fonts and etc.
Adding clip arts, change margins, spell check.

- **Spreadsheets** (MS Excel)
It organizes data in rows and columns in a worksheet. More
than 15 million cells can hold data. In cells you can add formulas or function, adding them can affect cells that are modified, automatically.

- **Database** (MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, FoxPro)
A system that collects data and allows access, retrieval and use of the
data. Data can contain text, numbers, dates or hyperlinks.You can sort, query and generate reports from it.

*Other Productivity Software*

- **Excel** - A Productivity tool when dealing in math and science situations. Charts and graphs can help visually in creating difference in numerical
data.

- **PowerPoint** - Enables teacher to make slides of their notes, Projecting slides onto a screen.
